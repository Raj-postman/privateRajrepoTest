Unauthorized:
  description: 'Unauthorized<hr>

            The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized,

NotFound:

            The server can not find the requested resource. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but 
            the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 to hide the existence 
            of a resource from an unauthorized client.'
